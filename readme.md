# raylib-zig-playgournd

**raylib-zig-playground** is a small [zig](https://ziglang.org/) environment for creating small tools or games based on [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

Build with `zig build`.

`program.zig` Is the main part of the program.

'watcher.zig` watches `program.zig` and restarts it on change. This makes iterating on the code more fun.

You can use `watch.bat` to start the watcher.

Note that this setup is currently works on Windows Only.

Enjoy!
